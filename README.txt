chung514 and huxxx952 collaborate

KenKen:
All code done.
Algorithms compared: AC3, backtracking with MAC, backtracking with MAC and MRV.
To run test, put all testcases with the same format with those on class repo, into "testKenKen.txt",
place the file under your working directory, and use the command

$ python3.4 KenKen_CSP.py

(No additional command needed.)


Futoshiki:
All code done.
Algorithms compared: AC3, backtracking with MAC, backtracking with MAC and MRV.
To run test, put all testcases with the same format with those on class repo, into "testFutoshiki.txt",
place the file under your working directory, and use the command

$ python3.4 Futoshiki_CSP.py


(No additional command needed.)


Additional work: Sudoku
All code done.
Algorithms compared: AC3, backtracking with MAC, backtracking with MAC and MRV.


To run test for CSP algorithms (AC3, backtracking), put all testcases with the format provided, into "testSudoku.txt",
place the file under your working directory, and use the command
