chung514 and huxxx952 collaborate

KenKen:
All code done.
Algorithms compared: AC3, backtracking with MAC, backtracking with MAC and MRV.
To run test, put all testcases with the same format with those on class repo, into "testKenKen.txt",
place the file under your working directory, and use the command

$ python KenKen_CSP.py

(No additional command needed.)


Futoshiki:
All code done.
Algorithms compared: AC3, backtracking with MAC, backtracking with MAC and MRV.
To run test, put all testcases with the same format with those on class repo, into "testFutoshiki.txt",
place the file under your working directory, and use the command

$ python Futoshiki_CSP.py


(No additional command needed.)


Additional work: Sudoku
All code done.
Algorithms compared: BFS, AC3, backtracking with MAC, backtracking with MAC and MRV.

To run test for BFS, please modify the problem list inside the script "Sudoku_BFS_test.py", put this script under the same directory with "BFSsudoku.py", and use the command
$ python Sudoku_BFS_test.py

(No additional command needed.)

To run test for CSP algorithms (AC3, backtracking), put all testcases with the format provided, into "testSudoku.txt",
place the file under your working directory, and use the command

$ python Sudoku_CSP.py

(No additional command needed.)
